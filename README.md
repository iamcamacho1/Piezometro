# Piezometro

# Nombre = Felipe Camacho Restrepo

I currently want to develop a web page were a civil-engineer company can log-in and create different projects, where in each of them, they can create objects (piezometers, either VWP or Casagrande) which will have some attributes, like depht, date of installation, coordenate and so. After that, the costumer will be able to add the periodical lectures of each instrument and it will update a database, which will convert the data into metrical measures, make graphics and create a document were the results are going to be printed out.
